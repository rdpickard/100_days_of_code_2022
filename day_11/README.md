Experiment to play around with writing a lexer and parser for a language.

Markdown is pretty straight forward and has decent reference information.

### Results

Partial implementation of the MD spec. The tokenizer works and the parser doesn't spit out an errors but
the HTML produced isn't what it should be based on the MD spec.

### If I was to do more
- Finish it. I think this is a good skill that has a bunch of different ways to implement a solution
- Nested lists don't work correctly
- Code blocks aren't implemented
- Tables aren't implemented

### Example output
