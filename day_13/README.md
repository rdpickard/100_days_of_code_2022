# Streak pre/post commit scripts (revisit)

```
Language: Python/bash
Brief: Generate a image for the commit streak in days and add it to the git repository
Scope: 
Tags: revisit, git
State:

```

The [day_6](../day_6/) and [day_8](../day_8) are kind of broken and it's annoying me. The image generation is only counting up to 10 days for some reason. The pre/post commit scripts are hacky and sometimes don't work. Redoing both days projects as a combined new project.

The goal is to for automatically create a image that shows the number of uninterrupted days I've added to this repository and update the repository with that image
