The dis-information researcher who goes by @conspirator0 on Twitter has posted about detecting sock puppet/bot Twitter accounts by identifying profile pictures that are from a GAN. Specifically that eye placement is a tell-tail sign of GAN image.

I wanted to see if computer vision eye detection would easily "witness marks" of a GAN.

My first pass as using OpenCV showed the eye detection of Haar Cascades generated false positives.

`Day 1 code` is to intended to reduce false positives by filtering unlikely eye candidates.

Filtered out false positives with a few passes 
- Any eye rectangles that overlapped with other eye rectanges
- Any eye rectangles that doesn't have exactly one other eye rectangle on the same horizontal plane
- Picked eye rectangle pairs that is the closest to the vertical mid point of the face image

Worked reasonably well. Code is a bit clunky. Nothing leaps out at my ultimate to see if GAN images can be detected with eye placement.
