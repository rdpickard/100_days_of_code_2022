Create a script to run the project from day_6 automatically on commit. 

Because this bash script will use the virtualenv of the 100 days project, this idea would generally be frowned upon by the folks who sheppard Git

[Activate virtualenv in hook template #1522](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/1522)

But since this 100 days endeavor is just a playground for ideas, I am going to ignore that good advice.
