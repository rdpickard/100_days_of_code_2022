Getting working with Rust was a little more involved than I thought. I limited myself to going through the first chapter of [Rust By Exmple](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello.html).

Some interesting stuff here. I think I see how the language is put together.

### Results

Finished the activities of each exercise in Chapter 1.

### Notes
The GitHub's default python .gitignore file include `target/` that covers Cargo. Is this OK?

Rust plugin to CLion defaults to building debug?

### If I was to do more
