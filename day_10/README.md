# Apple Podcasts recommendations walker

```
Language: Python
Brief: Walk podcast recommendations to a specified depth
Scope: experiment
Tags: web, disinformation
State: 
Result: 
```

Inspired by [trapezoid of discovery](https://twitter.com/get_innocuous) on Twitter's disinformation research work on a rightward ratchet of ideology.

Start with a search term, get recommendations, for each of those podcasts get the recommended podcasts, repeat. Put results in a tree.


### Results

Works pretty well. Only to a depth of one-podcast. 

I'm really interested in being able to pust JSON documents into an SQL DB mediated though SQLalchemy. I'm going to return to that for knowledge graphs.

### If I was to do more

- Extend to do recursion on podcast recommendations through the iTunes category algorithm. Should not be hard to do other than keeping track of depth to avoid infinite loops.
- Put the output into a format better suited for visualization. Like neo4j
- Rethink the Nodes and Edges SQLAlchemy objects. Make generic Node and Edge classes that are extended by specific types like a PodcastNode.
